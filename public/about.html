<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Suvajit Nandy, a 25-year-old enthusiast with a passion for exploration and creativity.
   My journey began at Calcutta University, where I earned my B.A. degree. 
   Alongside my studies, I have cultivated a love for gaming, gardening, and immersing myself in the tranquility of nature.</p>

<p>My current adventure involves diving into the world of web development.
   Guided by Dr. Angela Yuâ€™s Udemy course, Iâ€™m learning the intricacies of building digital experiences.
    Whether itâ€™s crafting elegant code or nurturing a new plant in my garden, I find joy in every step of the process.</p>

<p>Feel free to join me on this exciting rideâ€”I promise thereâ€™ll be more pixels, plants, and peaceful moments along the way!
